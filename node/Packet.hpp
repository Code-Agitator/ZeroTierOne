 * ZeroTier packet
 *
 * Packet format:
 *   <[8] 64-bit packet ID / crypto IV>
 *   <[5] destination ZT address>
 *   <[5] source ZT address>
 *   <[1] flags/cipher/hops>
 *   <[8] 64-bit MAC (or trusted path ID in trusted path mode)>
 *   [... -- begin encryption envelope -- ...]
 *   <[1] encrypted flags (MS 3 bits) and verb (LS 5 bits)>
 *   [... verb-specific payload ...]
 *
 * Packets smaller than 28 bytes are invalid and silently discarded.
 *
 * The 64-bit packet ID is a strongly random value used as a crypto IV.
 * Its least significant 3 bits are also used as a monotonically increasing
 * (and looping) counter for sending packets to a particular recipient. This
 * can be used for link quality monitoring and reporting and has no crypto
 * impact as it does not increase the likelihood of an IV collision. (The
 * crypto we use is not sensitive to the nature of the IV, only that it does
 * not repeat.)
 *
 * The flags/cipher/hops bit field is: FFCCCHHH where C is a 3-bit cipher
 * selection allowing up to 7 cipher suites, F is outside-envelope flags,
 * and H is hop count.
 *
 * The three-bit hop count is the only part of a packet that is mutable in
 * transit without invalidating the MAC. All other bits in the packet are
 * immutable. This is because intermediate nodes can increment the hop
 * count up to 7 (protocol max).
 *
 * For unencrypted packets, MAC is computed on plaintext. Only HELLO is ever
 * sent in the clear, as it's the "here is my public key" message.

	 * A packet fragment
	 *
	 * Fragments are sent if a packet is larger than UDP MTU. The first fragment
	 * is sent with its normal header with the fragmented flag set. Remaining
	 * fragments are sent this way.
	 *
	 * The fragmented bit indicates that there is at least one fragment. Fragments
	 * themselves contain the total, so the receiver must "learn" this from the
	 * first fragment it receives.
	 *
	 * Fragments are sent with the following format:
	 *   <[8] packet ID of packet whose fragment this belongs to>
	 *   <[5] destination ZT address>
	 *   <[1] 0xff, a reserved address, signals that this isn't a normal packet>

	 *   <[1] ZT hop count (top 5 bits unused and must be zero)>
	 *   <[...] fragment data>
	 *
	 * The protocol supports a maximum of 16 fragments. If a fragment is received
	 * before its main packet header, it should be cached for a brief period of
	 * time to see if its parent arrives. Loss of any fragment constitutes packet
	 * loss; there is no retransmission mechanism. The receiver must wait for full
